# DHCP Warning: If your flat interface device uses DHCP, there will be a hiccup while the network 
# is moved from the flat interface to the flat network bridge. This will happen when you launch 
# your first instance. Upon launch you will lose all connectivity to the node, and the vm launch will probably fail.
#
# If you are running on a single node and don't need to access the VMs from devices other than 
# that node, you can set the flat interface to the same value as FLAT_NETWORK_BRIDGE.
# This will stop the network hiccup from occurring.

**Anvil utility toolbelt**
==========================

multipip
--------

`pip` utility refuses to handle multiple requirements for one package::

    $ pip install 'nose>=1.2' 'nose>=2' 'nose<4'
    Double requirement given: nose>=2 (already in nose>=1.2, name='nose')

Use `multipip` to join these requirements::

    $ multipip 'nose>=1.2' 'nose>=2' 'nose<4'
    nose>=2,<4


`multipip` can be used to run `pip`::

   $ pip install $(multipip -r pip-requires)
   ...

Files of requirements can be used as well::

    $ cat pip-requires
    nose<4
    $ multipip 'nose>=1.2' 'nose>=2' -r pip-requires
    nose>=2,<4

`multipip` prints error messages for incompatible requirements to
stderr and chooses the first one (note: command-line requirements take
precedence over files)::

    $ cat pip-requires
    pip==1.3
    $ multipip 'pip==1.2' -r pip-requires
    pip: incompatible requirements
    Choosing:
    	command line: pip==1.2
    Conflicting:
    	-r pip-requires (line 1): pip==1.3
    pip==1.2

It is possible to filter some packages from printed output. This can
be useful for a huge `pip-requires` file::

    $ cat pip-requires
    nose<4
    pip==1.2
    nose>=1.2
    $ multipip -r pip-requires --ignore-packages nose
    pip==1.2

Installed packages can be filtered, too (they are taken from `pip
freeze`)::

    $ cat pip-requires
    nose<4
    pip==1.2
    nose>=1.2
    $ pip freeze | grep nose
    nose==1.1.2
    $ multipip -r pip-requires --ignore-installed
    pip==1.2

py2rpm
------

Distutils provides an interface for building RPMs::

    $ python ./setup.py bdist_rpm

This tool has several problems:

* Red Hat based distros use different package names, e.g.,
  `python-setuptools` instead of `distribute`, `python-nose` instead
  of `nose` and so on...
* `Requires` and `Conflicts` sections for generated RPM are incorrect.
* Sometimes not all required files are packaged.
* Miscellaneous problems with man files;
* Package directory in `/usr/lib*/python*/site-packages/<pkg>` is not
  owned by any RPM;
* Some packages (like selenium) are architecture dependent but
  `bdist_rpm` generates `BuildArch: noarch` for them.

`py2rpm` is aimed to solve all these problems.

`py2rpm` accepts a list of archive names or package directories and
builds RPMs (current directory is used by default)::

    $ py2rpm
    ...
    Wrote: /home/guest/rpmbuild/SRPMS/python-multipip-0.1-1.src.rpm
    Wrote: /home/guest/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/python-multipip-0.1-1.noarch.rpm
    ...


yyoom
-----

`yyoom` uses the yum API to provide nice command-line interface to package
management. It is able to install and remove packages in the same
transaction (see `yyoom transaction --help`), list available or installed
packages and a bit more. It writes results of its work to standard output
in JSON (which is much easier to use from other programs).

it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

(at your option) any later version.

explode_envra
-------------

`specprint` uses the rpm API to provide a interface to printing the details
of an rpm filename in a easy to parse format (aka the envra format). It writes results of its
work to standard output in JSON (which is much easier to use from other programs)::

    $ ./tools/explode_envra 'gtk3-3.10.9-1.fc20.x86_64.rpm' 'libxslt-1.1.28-5.fc20.x86_64.src.rpm'
    {"release": "1.fc20", "epoch": "", "version": "3.10.9", "arch": "x86_64", "name": "gtk3"}
    {"release": "5.fc20.x86_64", "epoch": "", "version": "1.1.28", "arch": "src", "name": "libxslt"}

specprint
---------

`specprint` uses the rpm API to provide a interface to printing the details
of an rpm spec file in a easy to parse format. It writes results of its work to
standard output in JSON (which is much easier to use from other programs)::

    $ ./tools/specprint -f python.spec

Getting Started
===============


Simple setup!
=============

Made to be as simple as possible, but not too simple.

Prerequisites
=============

RTFM
----

Read the great documentation for developers/admins at

- http://docs.openstack.org/developer/
- http://docs.openstack.org/

This will vastly help you understand what the
configurations and options do when ANVIL configures them.

Linux
-----

One of the tested distributions.

- RHEL 6.2+
- CentOS 6.2+
- Oracle Enteprise Linux 6.2+

You can get CentOS 6.2+ (**64-bit** is preferred) from https://www.centos.org/

Networking
----------

**Important!**
--------------

Since networking can affect how your cloud runs please check out this link:

http://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide-cloud/content/section_networking-nova.html

Check out the root article and the sub-chapters there to understand more
of what these settings mean.

**This is typically one of the hardest aspects of OpenStack to configure and get right!**

--------------

The following settings in ``conf/components/nova.yaml``  are an example of settings that will
affect the configuration of your compute nodes network.

::

     flat_network_bridge: br100
     flat_interface: eth0
     public_interface: eth0
     fixed_range: 10.0.0.0/24
     fixed_network_size: 256
     floating_range: 172.24.4.224/28
     test_floating_pool: test
     test_floating_range: 192.168.253.0/29


Installation
============

Pre-setup
---------

Since RHEL requires a `tty`_ to perform ``sudo`` commands we need
to disable this so ``sudo`` can run without a `tty`_. This seems needed
since nova and other components attempt to do ``sudo`` commands. This
isn’t possible in RHEL unless you disable this (since those
instances won’t have a `tty`_).

::

    $ sudo visudo

Then comment out line

::

    Default requiretty

Also disable selinux:

::

     $ sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/selinux

Change `SELINUX=enforcing` to `SELINUX=disabled` then reboot.

::

     $ sudo reboot

Create specifc user to isolate all the Anvil processes from root user

::

    $ sudo useradd <username>
    $ sudo passwd <username>

Set user as sudoer

::

    $ sudo visudo

Add `<username>     ALL=(ALL)       ALL`

Make all the rest of actions as <username> user

::

    $ sudo su - <username>

Get git!
--------

::

    $ sudo yum install git -y


Download
--------

We’ll grab the latest version of ANVIL via git:

::

    $ git clone git://github.com/stackforge/anvil.git
    $ cd anvil


Configuration
-------------

Any configuration to be updated should now be done.

Please edit the corresponding yaml files in ``conf/components/`` or ``conf/components/personas``
to fit your desired configuration of nova/glance and the other OpenStack components.
You can use ``-p <conf/components/required_file.yaml>`` option with following commands
to use configuration files.

To specify which versions of OpenStack components you want to install select or edit origins configuration
file from ``<conf/origins/>`` and use it as follows ``-o <conf/origins/origins_file.yaml>``.

Networking notes for those on RedHat/CentOS/Fedora
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are planning on using the `FlatManager`_ then you might want to read and follow:

* http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Creating_an_RHEL_5_KVM_Networked_Bridge_Interface

Respository notes for those with RedHat subscriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable the needed repositories for various requirements please also run::

    sudo subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-6-server-optional-rpms

You can also include the `RDO`_ repositories (which has even more of the needed
requirements). This will ensure that anvil has to build less dependencies overall.

* http://openstack.redhat.com/Repositories

Pre-installing
--------------

In order to ensure that anvil will have its correct dependencies you need to first run the
bootstrapping code that will setup said dependencies for your operating system.

::

    sudo ./smithy --bootstrap

Preparing
---------

Now prepare *OpenStacks* components by running the following:

::

    ./smithy -a prepare

You should see a corresponding OpenStack repositories getting downloaded using
git, python setups occurring and configuration files being written as well as
source rpm packages being built and a repository setup from those components [#verbose]_.

Building
--------

Now build *OpenStacks* components by running the following:

::

    sudo ./smithy -a build

You should see a corresponding OpenStack components and dependencies at this
stage being packaged into rpm files and two repositories being setup for you [#verbose]_.
One repository will be the dependencies that the OpenStack components need to run and the
other will be the OpenStack components themselves.

Installing
----------

Now install *OpenStacks* components by running the following:

::

    sudo ./smithy -a install

You should see a set of distribution packages and/or pips being
installed and configuration files being written as ANVIL figures out how to
install your desired components from the prepared packages built in the last
step [#verbose]_.

**Note:** You can specify conf file just like in the ``prepare`` action.
Without a specified conf file the command will execute with ``conf/personas/in-a-box/basic.yaml``

**Note:** Also to avoid qemu errors please follow the solution @ https://bugs.launchpad.net/anvil/+bug/985786
which will ensure that the ``qemu`` user can write to your instances directory. If needed edit ``conf/components/nova.yaml``
and also adjust the ``instances_path`` option.

Also as documented at http://docs.openstack.org/essex/openstack-compute/admin/content/qemu.html#fixes-rhel-qemu
please run the following (**after** installation).

::

    $ setsebool -P virt_use_execmem on # optional
    $ sudo ln -s /usr/libexec/qemu-kvm /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64
    $ sudo service libvirtd restart


Testing
----------

Now (if you choose) you can run each *OpenStack* components unit tests by running the following:

::

    sudo ./smithy -a test

You should see a set of unit tests being ran (ideally with zero failures) [#verbose]_.

Starting
--------

Now that you have installed *OpenStack* you can now start your
*OpenStack* components by running the following [#verbose]_.

::

    sudo ./smithy -a start


Check horizon (if applicable)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once that occurs you should be able to go to your hosts ip with a web
browser and view horizon which can be logged in with the user ``admin``
and the password you entered when prompted for.

If you see a login page and can access horizon then:

``Congratulations. You did it!``

Command line tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In your ANVIL directory:

::

    source /etc/anvil/install.rc

This should set up the environment variables you need to run OpenStack
CLI tools:

::

    nova <command> [options] [args]
    nova-manage <command> [options] [args]
    keystone <command> [options] [args]
    glance <command> [options] [args]
    ....

If you desire to use eucalyptus tools (ie `euca2ools`_) which use the
EC2 apis run the following to get your EC2 certs:

::

    ./tools/euca.sh $OS_USERNAME $OS_TENANT_NAME

It broke?
~~~~~~~~~

First run the following to check the status of each component [#verbose]_.

::

    sudo ./smithy -a status

If you do not see all green status then you should run the following and see
if any of the ``/var/log/nova,glance,keystone,cinder,...`` log files will give you more information
about what is occuring.

::

    sudo ./smithy -a status --show
    
This will dump out those files (truncated to not be to verbose) so that anything
peculaliar can be seen. If nothing can be then go to the installation directory (typically ``~/openstack``)
and check the ``traces`` directory of each component and check if anything looks fishy.

Stopping
--------

Once you have started *OpenStack* services you can stop them by running
the following:

::

    sudo ./smithy -a stop

You should see a set of stop actions happening [#verbose]_. This
ensures the above a daemon that was started is now killed. 

**Note:** A good way to check if it killed everything correctly is to run the following.

::

    sudo ps -elf | grep python
    sudo ps -elf | grep apache

There should be no entries like ``nova``, ``glance``, ``apache``,
``httpd``. If there are then the stop may have not occurred correctly.
If this is the case run again with a ``-v`` or a ``-vv`` or check the
``/var/log/nova,glance,keystone,cinder,...`` files for any useful information on what
is happening.

Uninstalling
------------

Once you have installed and stopped *OpenStack* services you
can uninstall them by running the following:

::

    sudo ./smithy -a uninstall

You should see a set of packages being removed [#verbose]_.

Purging
-------

Once you have uninstalled *OpenStack* services you
can purge the whole anvil installation by running the following:

::

    sudo ./smithy -a purge

You should see a set of packages, configuration and directories, being
removed [#verbose]_. On completion the directory specified at
~/openstack should be empty.
